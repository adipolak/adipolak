[Take the plunge of distributed machine learning training with Spark, Pytorch and TensorFlow]([https://github.com/adipolak/ml-with-apache-spark](https://github.com/adipolak/ml-with-apache-spark/tree/main/notebooks))

### Hi there 👋

A wee bit about me: I am an experienced Software Engineer and people manager with technical expertise in Apache Spark, HDFS, AWS, Azure, machine learning, and distributed large-scale systems.

I'm highly motivated, and always excited about solving problems and learning. I possess a curious, positive, and can-do attitude. Drove success and improvement for both distributed machine systems and people systems, optimizing Spark cluster, driving +350%  throughout at Akamai scale [billions of events a day, processing 1.3PT], saving the company money on compute and optimizing complex ml model deployment from months to 2–3 days cycle, by aligning people-based systems, influencing strategic software integrations, and adopting software best practices.

I have been honored with the Beacon award in the Databricks Ambassadors Program, a testament to my commitment to contributing to data and AI technologies and sharing my expertise with others.
